# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolioâ€”a responsive website with custom color schemes, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered by Vue3.js and Vite. Designed initially from a template, it served as an exercise in enhancing my skills and understanding of front-end technologies. Utilizing a Pinia store for dynamic content and states, this portfolio is deployed as a secure, public HTTPS site using AWS CloudFront and an S3 bucket.
